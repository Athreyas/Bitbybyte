Hello, I’m **Art**, a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) passionate about infrastructure, coding, and learning new technologies. This is my personal space where I document all the cool things I’m learning! Whether it's **Python scripting**, **Docker** containers, or the wonders of **Kubernetes**, you'll find everything here.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here:

### 🖥️ Programming & Scripting
As an SRE, I spend a lot of time scripting in **Python**. Recently, I’ve been diving into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to structure my code better.
- [OOP Basics](oop.md)
- [Python Tips & Tricks](python-tips.md)

### 🐳 Docker & Kubernetes Adventures
I’ve been exploring the world of **Docker** and **Kubernetes**! If you're interested in containerization and managing complex infrastructures, check out my notes:
- [Docker 101](docker.md)
- [Kubernetes in Action](kubernetes.md)

### ⚙️ Automation with Ansible
I primarily work with **Ansible** to manage and automate infrastructure tasks. It’s a powerful tool that helps scale systems efficiently. Find out how I use Ansible to automate everything!
- [Ansible Playbooks](ansible.md)

## 🔧 Projects I'm Working On:
### 1. **Half Marathon Training App** 🏃‍♂️
As I’m currently training for a half marathon, I’m developing a Python app that helps runners track progress and improve breathing techniques during runs.
- [Half Marathon Training App](projects/half-marathon.md)

### 2. **Learning Hub Blog** ✍️
This website! It's powered by GitHub Pages, and I’m using it to document everything I’m learning.
