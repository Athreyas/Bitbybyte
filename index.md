# Learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Docker: A Beginner's Journey

Welcome to **Learning Hub**, where I'm documenting my journey of learning various topics with the help of AI. In this post, we'll cover two important topics: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Docker**. I'll explain them in a super simple way, perfect for beginners or anyone looking for a refresh!

## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a way of organizing your code by creating "objects" that represent real-world things. These objects can store data (called **attributes**) and perform actions (called **methods**). Let's dive into the core concepts.

### Classes and Objects
- **Class**: Think of it as a blueprint for creating objects. For example, if you want to create a car, you'd start with a blueprint (a class) that describes what every car should have (like wheels and an engine).
- **Object**: This is the actual car built from the blueprint. You can create many objects (cars) from one class (blueprint).

```python
class Car:
    pass  # A blueprint for cars

my_car = Car()  # Creates a new car (object)
