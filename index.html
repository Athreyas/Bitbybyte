    <h2 id="what-is-object-oriented-programming-oop">What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?</h2>
    <p>OOP is a way of organizing your code by creating "objects" that represent real-world things. These objects can store data (called <strong>attributes</strong>) and perform actions (called <strong>methods</strong>).</p>

    <h3>Classes and Objects</h3>
    <p>Class: Think of it as a blueprint for creating objects. For example, if you want to create a car, you'd start with a blueprint (a class) that describes what every car should have (like wheels and an engine).</p>
    <p>Object: This is the actual car built from the blueprint. You can create many objects (cars) from one class (blueprint).</p>

    <pre>
<code>
class Car:
    pass  # A blueprint for cars

my_car = Car()  # Creates a new car (object)
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h2>
    <p>Docker is like a magic box where you put everything your program needs to run (code, libraries, tools, etc.), and when you give the box to someone else, the program runs the same way on their computer too.</p>

    <h2 id="docker-and-kubernetes">Docker and Kubernetes</h2>
    <p>Docker is great for running individual containers, but what if you have hundreds of containers? Thatâ€™s where Kubernetes (K8s) comes in!</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Today, we learned the basics of OOP and Docker!</p>
